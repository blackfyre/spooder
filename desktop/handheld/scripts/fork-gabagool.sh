# The patched gabagool the handheld builds against (openspec change
# add-handheld-controller, design D5): downloads the pinned release through the
# go command, which checks it against the checksum database, checks the module
# hash against the pin below as well, copies it to build/handheld/gabagool and
# applies third_party/gabagool-power-hook.patch (checked first). The copy is
# made beside the target and swapped in at the end, so a failed run leaves the
# previous copy in place and the task can run any number of times.
#
# Run from the repository root (mise run handheld-fork).
